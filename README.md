# The Hero's Journey ðŸš€

The Hero's Journey is a game that was created during project week by Richard Mckenzie, Leah Chen, Eliana Calote and Indya Molloy.

> _Sometimes we are clouded by intrusive thoughts that can make us lose our way... but together we can tackle these problems and become the heroes of our own story!_

 Let's embark on [**The Hero's Journey**](https://theherosjourney.netlify.app/)!

## The Problem 

Throughout the bootcamp we have our many highs, but with highs comes some lows... At some point of the journey a bootcamper may experience something called, "Imposter Syndrome," and ultimately begin to perceive themselves a fraud as they doubt their abilities and skills.

So, how do we find a solution for this? How can we eliminate that feeling of self-doubt of the bootcampers who have undergone this incredible _(but difficult)_ journey?

## The Solution

The [School of Code](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode) has always been the beginning of a new chapter to our life story the moment we submitted our application forms, and so 
for our solution to the problem, we wanted to tell a story. A story that will resonates with the bootcamper as they reflect on their journey with our solution - a game!

We created a point-and-click game because we wanted to add a positive and a fun spin to the problem. The game is be played in a team during the "Energiser" of our day; this is to promote teamwork and communication between the bootcampers as they explore the stages and tackle problems together. _(Just like in paired programming!)_

The journey the bootcampers go through represents the different phases of the School of Code journey, from the different technologies learnt to the awareness of self from the mindset sessions. 

The feeling evoked upon playing the game will diminish those "Imposter Syndrome" thoughts and give a sense of accomplishment of how much each bootcamper has achieved in a short amount of time. 

**Bootcampers should be proud of how far they have come, and how much they have learnt! â˜ºï¸Ž**
